            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>VVE marched from <hi>Berwick</hi> upon Monday, being the Two and twentieth day of <hi>July,</hi> and lay at my Lord <hi>Mordingtons</hi> Houſe, Monday night, Tueſday and Wedneſday; on Thurſday we marched to <hi>Copperſpeth,</hi> on Friday to <hi>Dunbar,</hi> where we got ſome ſmall pittance from our Ships; from thence we marched to <hi>Haddington:</hi> On the Lords-Day, hearing that the Scottiſh Army meant to meet us at <hi>Gladſmore,</hi> we labored to poſſeſs the Moor before them, and beat our Drums very early in the Morning, but when we came there, no conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Body of the Army appeared, whereupon 1400 Horſe under the Command of Major General <hi>Lambert,</hi> and Colonel <hi>Whalley,</hi> were ſent as a Van-Guard to <hi>Muſcleborough,</hi> to ſee likewiſe if they could finde out and attempt any thing upon the Enemy; I marching in the heel of them with the reſidue of the Army; our Party encountred with ſome of their Horſe, but they could not abide us: We lay at <hi>Muſcleborough</hi> incamped cloſe that Night, the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Army lying between <hi>Edenburgh</hi> and <hi>Leith,</hi> about four Miles from us, intrenched by a Line Flankered from <hi>Edenburgh to Leith;</hi> the Guns alſo from <hi>Leith</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:117390:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſcouring moſt parts of the Line, ſo that they lay very ſtrong Upon Monday the 29<hi rend="sup">th</hi> inſtant, we were reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to draw up to them, to ſee if they would fight with us, and when we came upon the place, we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to get our Canons as near them as we could, hoping thereby to annoy them; we likewiſe perceived that they had ſome force upon a Hill that overlooks <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> from whence we might be annoyed, did reſolve to ſend up a Party to poſſeſs the ſaid Hill, which prevailed; but upon the whole, we did finde that their Army were not eaſily to be attempted, whereupon we lay ſtill all the ſaid day, which proved to be ſo ſore a day and night of Rain, as I have ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſeen, and greatly to our diſadvantage, the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my having enough to cover them, and we nothing at all conſiderable: Our Soldiers did abide this difficulty with great courage and reſolution, hoping they ſhould ſpeedily come to fight; in the morning the ground being very wet, our Proviſions ſearce, we reſolved to draw back to our Quarters at <hi>Muſcleborough,</hi> there to refreſh and revictual: The Enemy when we drew off, fell upon our Rear, and put them into ſome little diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, but our Bodies of Horſe being in ſome readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, came to a grable with them, where indeed there was a gallant and hot diſpute; the Major General and and Colonel <hi>Whalley,</hi> being in the Rear, and the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my drawing out great Bodies to ſecond their firſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front; our men charged them up to the very Trenches, and beat them in, the Major General his Horſe was ſhot in the neck and head, himſelf run through the Arm with a Lance, and run into another place of his Body, was taken Priſoner by the Enemy, but reſcued immediately by Lieutenant <hi>Empſon</hi> of my Regiment;
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:117390:3"/>
Colonel <hi>Whalley</hi> who was then neareſt to the Major General, did charge very reſolutely, and repulſed the Enemy, and killed divers of them upon the place, and took ſome priſoners without any conſiderable loſs, which indeed did ſo amaze and quiet them, that we marched off to <hi>Muſcleborough,</hi> but they dar'd not ſend out a man to trouble us; we hear their yong King looked on upon all this, but was very ill ſatisfied to ſee their men do no better; we came to <hi>Muſcleborough</hi> that night, ſo tired and wearied for want of ſleep, and ſo dirty by reaſon of the wetneſs of the weather, that we expected the Enemy would make an infal upon us, which accordingly they did, between three and four of the clock this morning with fifteen of their moſt ſelect Troops, under the command of Major General <hi>Montgomery</hi> and <hi>Straughan,</hi> two Champions of the Church, upon which buſineſs there was great hope and expectation laid, the Enemy came on with a great deal of Reſolution, beat in our Guards, and put a Regiment of Horſe in ſome diſorder, but our men ſpeedily taking the Alarum, charged the Enemy, rout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, took many Priſoners, killed a great many of them, did Execution within a quarter of a Mile of <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> and as I am informed, <hi>Straughan</hi> was killed there, beſides divers other Officers of Quality; we took the Major to <hi>Straughans</hi> Regiment, Major <hi>Humilton;</hi> a Lieurenant Colonel, and divers other Officers and perſons of Quality, whom yet we know not. Indeed this is a ſweet beginning of your buſineſs, or rather the Lords, and I believe is not very ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory to the Enemy, eſpeically to the Kirk party, we did not loſe any in this buſineſs ſo far as I hear, but a Corner, I do not hear of four men more; the Major
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:117390:4"/>
General will, I believe, within few days be well to take the Field, and I truſt this work which is the Lords, will proſper in the hands of his Servants. I did not think it adviſeable to attempt upon the Enemy lying as he doth, but ſurely it would ſufficiently provoke him to fight if he had a minde to it; I do not think he is leſs then Six or ſeven thouſand Horſe, and Fourteen or fifteen thouſand Foot; The reaſon I hear that they give out to their People why they do not fight us, is becauſe they expect many Bodies of men more out of the North of <hi>Scotland,</hi> which when they come, they give out they will then engage; But I believe, they would rather tempt us to attempt them in their faſt Nets, within which they are intrenched, or elſe hoping we ſhall famiſh for want of proviſions, which is very likely to be, if we be not timely and fully ſupplyed. I remain,</p>

            <p>MY laſt acquainted you with our Advance into <hi>Scotland,</hi> you may expect to hear of ſome Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The people had generally deſerted their Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſome few women onely were left behinde; yet we had this mercy, That their houſe thus forſaken, were indifferently well furniſhed with Beer, Wine, and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:117390:4"/>
Corn, which was a very good ſupply to us: Our Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers were civil and orderly, which gains much upon the Countrey.</p>
            <p>On the 26 of this inſtant we came to <hi>Haddington,</hi> where we received intelligence, That the <hi>Scots</hi> Army had Rendezvouzed that day, and purpoſed to march all that night to meet us on a Moor, betwixt <hi>Muſcle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi> and <hi>Haddington,</hi> called <hi>Gladſmoor;</hi> we drew out our Army early in the morning expecting an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement; but miſſing thereof, and meeting with no certain intelligence where their Army was, we drew out a party of Fifteen hundred Horſe, commanded by Major General <hi>Lambert,</hi> which had a Forlorn of Two hundred Horſe led by Major <hi>Heyne.</hi> Theſe advanced before the Body of our Army to give ſome notice where their Army lay; our Forlorn had ſome light skirmiſhes with theirs, we ſtill preſt on till we had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered ſome Bodies of their Horſe drawn up about a mile and an half on this ſide <hi>Leith:</hi> Upon the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our Party, they retreated; our Forlorn ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced after them, but they quickly got under the ſhelter of their Works; ſo that nothing conſiderable was done that day.</p>
            <p>We quartered that night at <hi>Muſcleborough,</hi> within four Miles of their Camp; we then found that they encamped between <hi>Leith</hi> and <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> and had entrenched themſelves very ſtrongly, drawing their Trench from the <hi>Leith</hi> to the foot of <hi>Cannygate</hi> ſtreet in <hi>Edinburgh;</hi> and all along the Line they had mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed very many peeces of Ordnance. The next morning being the 28 of <hi>July</hi> Inſtant, we drew out our Army, ſuppoſing that they would have given us battel, and a plain field for the deciding of our Work. Our For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorn
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:117390:5"/>
of Horſe was commanded by Major <hi>Brown;</hi> a Party of Two hundred Foot led by Major <hi>Cobbet,</hi> with an Hundred Horſe, were to poſſeſs the Mickle Hill on this ſide <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> where ſome of their Muskertiers lay popping at us; They quickly made themſelves Maſters of that Hill; which if their Army had main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and planted great Guns upon it, they might have very much galled the left wing of our Army: They had no ſuch intentions as to come to us, onely ſome ſmall Bodies of their Horſe appeared, but they were ſuddenly beaten back again; we quartered that night within leſs then Musket ſhot of their intrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. It began to Rain about five of the clock in the Evening, and it proved as ſad and wet a night, as ever was endured: The next morning perceiving they would not fight, and viewing the ſtrength of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchments, the Soldiers having endured ſo bitter a night, we drew-off to quarters, for the refreſhment of our men and horſes. They have made themſelves ſo ſtrong lying under the command of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> Caſtle, and of <hi>Leith,</hi> that we could not come neer them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the apparent hazard of the loſe of our Army: Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our drawing off, they endeavored to fall on our Reer, which was done with as great advantage on their part, as might be; and yet (through the goodneſs of God) it proved to their loſs: They had kept our Rear-guard too long pickering, till great Bodies of Horſe, which we could not judg to be leſs then a thouſand, appeared near them both on their Rear, and on their Flanck: and indeed, before they could reach the Rear of our Army, they were forced into ſome diſorder; but one of our Rear Troops received ours, and put theirs to a ſtand. At length we rallied up, and dividing
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:117390:5"/>
into two parts, we charged both their Bodies of Horſe home, purſuing them to their very Works. Tis ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed we killed Fifty or Sixty of theirs, wounding more, and taking ſome priſoners: This gave an Alarm to the Van of our Army, who were all drawn off; but they would not come out to give us battel, though we drew up in their view. We loſt ſome few, Captain <hi>Glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> with ſome others being wounded; the Major General himſelf received two wounds in his Arm and Thigh, by their Lances; he was taken priſoner, but reſcued by Lieutenant <hi>Empſon.</hi> They refuſing to fight, we drew off to <hi>Muſcleborough</hi> to quarters; the enemy taking advantage at our wearineſs, about the break of the day, this morning, being the 30 of this inſtant <hi>July,</hi> attempted to make a deſperate Charge upon our quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters with Eight hundred of their choice Horſe. This they did very reſolutely; and our Guard of Horſe being ſomewhat negligent, they routed them, and came to our very Town Gate, till our Musquettiers, and a peece of Ordnance had diſcharged, and done execution upon them, they were put to a ſtand, and received by two Troops of Colonel <hi>Lilburns</hi> Horſe very gallant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: falling upon us ſuddenly, before we could well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Alarm, they mightily diſordered our Horſe, and wounded many of our men: At length our men rallied and charged them home, and purſued them to their very works, which was 4 miles; and in their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit, they killed and wounded many of them, taking divers priſoners. Sir <hi>Robert Montgomery</hi> their Major General, commanded their Party, with whom Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel <hi>Straughan</hi> (once our Friend) was, it is thought he is killed: We have taken a Lieutenant Colonel, a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor, ſome Captains, and other Officers priſoners:
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:117390:6"/>
The number we have ſlain is not yet known; priſoners are ſtill brought in, we may conjecture they will return back above One hundred leſs then they came forth. This was a very great Mercy to us, and a check to them. We have one Captain of theirs priſoner, and he is much wounded, whom they value and account of very high for their Kirk: We had a Cornet killed whoſe Colours were alſo taken; it was but in part a requital of what we did to them yeſterday, for we took two of their Colours. Their King came to them on Monday, and viewed their Army; His Coronation day is ſhortly to be ſolemnized. We much wonder that none of the honeſt Party amongſt them do fall off yet to us; if they would appear, our work might receive a more ſpeedy reſult: They expect more Forces out of the North, they report to the number of about Five or Six thouſand.

            <p>VVE are now come near <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> before which the Army, Horſe and Foot, were drawn upon Monday laſt: The Enemy had lined the Park Wall with Musketiers about a mile from the Town: A party of our Musketiers were ſent to beat them from it, eſpecially in regard it gave them a view of the Army; this they did, and the Enemy fled to their Body, who lay encamped upon a Hill near the City. Order was given for the drawing up a piece of Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance upon <hi>Arthurs-Hill,</hi> which played upon the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and made them give back to their Trenches, which they had made between <hi>Edenburgh</hi> and <hi>Leith,</hi> to ſecure themſelves. The Army ſtood in Battalia all the night, but the Enemy not willing to leave their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages; and it not being adviſable to fall upon our Enemy, far above our number, who had two Gari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and a Line to defend themſelves, beſides the extraordinary wet that fell that night and the next morning. The Army had Order to march back to <hi>Muſcleborough,</hi> which they did: The Enemy percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it, a great party of their Horſe iſſued forth to fall upon our Rere, which received their Charge, and after an hot Diſpute, forc'd them Retreat into the Town. In this Skirmiſh Major General <hi>Lambert</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a ſlight hurt, Captain <hi>Gladman,</hi> Captain <hi>Fenis,</hi> and ſome others of ours wounded; divers of theirs killed, and ſome taken: A party of the countrey of above Five hundred were gathered together on the Hill near this Town, but Routed by Major <hi>Haynes.</hi> This morning about four of the clock, Fifteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of the Enemies beſt Horſe, commanded by Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor

jor General <hi>Montgomery</hi> (being many of them drunk, had engaged to the Prince (who came to <hi>Edenburgh</hi> the other night) That they would bring him the Lord General <hi>Cromwel</hi> alive or dead) gave an Alarm to the Army, and came up to <hi>Muſcleborough,</hi> under the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Friends; but being diſcovered, they were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred with, and Routed, ſo that not One hundred of them got back to <hi>Edenburgh.</hi> There was above Forty ſlain; Colonel <hi>Straughan,</hi> a Lieutenant Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, a Maior, a Captain, a Lieutanant, and divers other Officers, and many Soldiers ſlain, whoſe bodies lay ſcattered all the way between this and <hi>Edenburgh.</hi> Major General <hi>Montgomery</hi> was ſlain in the purſuit.</p>

               <p>THe Lord hath been pleaſed to manifeſt his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and owning of us, and witneſſed, That we are not a people forſaken; but he doth declare, That our Cauſe is that wherein his Name and Glory is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned; and that the Lord doth own us, is matter to me of the greateſt reioycing.</p>
               <p>Monday the Nineteenth of July we drew near to the Enemy, and poſſeſt our ſelves of a convenient Hill, where the Enemy lay, on that ſide of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> that goes to <hi>Leith,</hi> having drawn a Line from that city to <hi>Leith</hi> ſtrongly fortified. Our deſign in march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo near, was to provoke the Enemy to fight; but God took away their courage, and they ſuffered us to take our ground without oppoſition, where we intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to fight, in caſe they durſt draw forth, which they did not, though both Armies fac'd each other. We lay all night in the field (which proved extreme wet) yet the Lord gave our men great courage, and contented<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with their hardſhip, which indeed was a choyce Mercy, conſidering what want of proviſion our men had, the countrey not affording relief, and the Ships from <hi>London</hi> not come to us: But God ſupplyed all, by giving the Army quietneſs under all their ſtraits.</p>
               <p>The two Blows given by our Army to the Enemy on Tueſday and Wedneſday, hath ſtrook ſo much ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror into them, that I do not think they will be able to keep together.</p>

               <p>This was the party they moſt relyed upon, as being eſpecially conſecrated by the Kirk to this Service.</p>

               <p>That this party went near ſixteen miles about, to get their beſt opportunity for falling on, and after ſome of Colonel <hi>Lilburns</hi> men had firſt taken the Alarm, two of the Enemies came up as friends (being Engliſh) and ſaid it was falſe: whereupon our diſmounted, and ſo the Enemy came on immediately, yet did little prejudice, onely Colonel <hi>Lilburns</hi> Cornet killed, and two or three others hurt.</p>
